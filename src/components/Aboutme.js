        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a <strong>2nd year Computer Engineering student (AIML)</strong> at
          Bharati Vidyapeeth, with strong foundations in programming, web
          development, and creative technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve worked on projects such as a{" "}
          <strong>Business & Finance Management System </strong>
          and a <strong>Car Physics Engine</strong>, which helped me sharpen my
          problem-solving and software design skills. My technical toolkit
          includes
          <strong>
            {" "}
            Java, Spring Boot, React, React Native, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript,
          </strong>
          along with a passion for <strong>UI/UX design</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also explore creative and immersive technologies — from
          <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> for game development to{" "}
          <strong>Photoshop</strong> and
          <strong> After Effects</strong> for design and motion graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to combine <strong>technical problem-solving</strong> with
          <strong> innovative design</strong> to build impactful software
          solutions, continuously learning and contributing to the world of
          <strong>
            {" "}
            software development, web applications, and game technologies
          </strong>
          .
